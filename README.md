# API Platform Tutorial

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script
for the [API Platform](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/api-platform) course on SymfonyCasts.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**1) Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**2) Start the symfony web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
works even better - especially if you're using Docker for
the database.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve -d
```

(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).

Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`. You'll see
an error now - finish the setup instructions to get things working!

** 3) Database Setup (with Docker)**

The easiest way to set up the database is to use the `docker-compose.yaml`
file that's included in this project. First, make sure Docker is downloaded
and running on your machine. Then, from inside the project, run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Congrats! You now have a database running! And as long as you use the
"symfony binary" web server (described below), the `DATABASE_URL`
environment variable will automatically be exposed to your web server:
no need to configure `.env`.

For more information about this approach, see https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony5-doctrine

** 3 Alternative) Database Setup (without Docker)**

If you do not want to use Docker, you can also just install and run
MySQL manually. When you're done, open the `.env` file and make any
adjustments you need - specifically `DATABASE_URL`. Or, better,
you can create a `.env.local` file and *override* any configuration
you need there (instead of changing `.env` directly).

** 4) Database Schema**

To actually *create* the database and get some tables, run:

```
symfony console doctrine:database:create
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

This uses the `symfony` binary, but `symfony console` is identical
to `php bin/console`, except that this allows the `DATABASE_URL`
environment variable to be injected if you're using Docker.

If you get an error that the database exists, that should
be ok. But if you have problems, completely drop the
database (`doctrine:database:drop --force`) and try again.

** 4b) Database Schema for Tests**

To execute the tests, you may (if you're using the Docker integration)
need to also initialize the database inside the test database container:

```
symfony console doctrine:database:create --env=test
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=test
```

** 5) Optional: Compiling Webpack Encore Assets**

This tutorial uses [Webpack Encore](https://symfonycasts.com/encore),
which isn't important to understand what's going on. The compiled
assets are already included in the download, so unless you want to
play around with the JavaScript, you can skip this step.

Make sure to install Node and also [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
Then run:

```
yarn install
yarn encore dev --watch
```

Have fun!

## Have Ideas, Feedback or an Issue?
